- This repository is a pytorch implementation of the TREQS model for Question-to-SQL generation proposed in our WWW'20 paper:
[Text-to-SQL Generation for Question Answering on Electronic Medical Records](http://dmkd.cs.vt.edu/papers/WWW20.pdf). 
-In this work, we also created a large-scale dataset MIMICSQL for Question-to-SQL task in healthcare domain. The MIMICSQL dataset is provided in folder [mimicsql_data](https://github.com/wangpinggl/TREQS/tree/master/mimicsql_data) in this repository. More details about MIMICSQL dataset are provided below.

## Dataset
MIMICSQL is created based on the publicly available real-world [Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC III)](https://mimic.physionet.org/gettingstarted/access/) dataset. MIMICSQL has two subsets, in which the first set is composed of template questions (machine generated), while the second consists of natural language questions (human annotated).
